# Beautiful Football ETL with Apache Airflow

A beautiful, automated ETL pipeline built with **Apache Airflow** that extracts football data from a public API, creates relational tables in an **Oracle Database**, and loads cleaned, structured data.

It supports **incremental updates** via Airflow Variables and XComs, ensures **referential integrity**, and runs on a **scheduled basis**.
